Demo steps

1. Start the server: `node server/index.js`
2. Open a webpage and include a script tag referencing `/ai-navigation-agent/src/ai-agent.js`.
3. Use the floating widget to ask simple questions (e.g., "Highlight the title").

Notes: This is a scaffold — replace server AI logic with a real model integration for production.
