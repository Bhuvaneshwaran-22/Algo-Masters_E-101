# AI Navigation Agent (scaffold)

Small scaffold that injects a floating widget, reads page DOM, and exposes a simple AI endpoint.

Quick start:

1. cd ai-navigation-agent
2. npm install express
3. node server/index.js
4. Serve your site and include `ai-navigation-agent/src/ai-agent.js` on pages to try the widget.
